# Mr. Incredible (Un)canny Faces

A small Visual Studio Code extension to show Mr. Incredible's face becoming canny or uncanny depending of the number of warnings and errors you have in your code! The faces are taken from the official [Mr. Incredible Becoming Uncanny wiki](https://the-uncanny-incredible.fandom.com/wiki/Mr_Incredible_Becoming_Uncanny)!

This extension is highly "inspired" from Incredibly In Your Face developed by [Virej Dasani](https://virejdasani.github.io/).
